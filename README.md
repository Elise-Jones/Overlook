# Overlook

This application allows customers to search and book rooms at Overlook Hotel. They are able to search by date and by room type. The application keeps track of the total amount they spent at the hotel. Each customer has their own username and password.

## Learning Goals
As a Mod 2 student at Turing, our learning goals were not only to improve our skills using writing HTM, CSS, and Javascript but also practicing with using API's. 

Also the goal was to continue practicing test driven development by creating our functions separately from the DOM and testing with sample data.
